# Frequently asked questions

## What is OpenE2140?

OpenE2140 is a reimagining of Earth 2140, the classic RTS game originally developed by the Polish-based Reality Pump Studios. It is built on the [open-source RTS engine OpenRA](https://www.openra.net).

This project is a work in progressâ€”some features are fully functional, while others are still being developed or may contain bugs and occasionally crash. For more details, please refer to [the page with release notes and known issues]({% link known-issues.md %}).


## What is Earth 2140?

It is a real-time strategy with heavy inspiration in the first two Command and Conquer games with its own tweaked game mechanics, visuals and original soundtrack. The game was released in 1997 and received two more expansions - Mission Pack 1 and Mission Pack 2 in 1998.


## What changes does it bring compared to the original game?

OpenE2140 **is not** a *source port*--it does not recreate the original game exactly, nor is that possible due to the architecture of OpenRA. Instead, it aims to capture the spirit and gameplay of Earth 2140 while introducing modern features and enhancements. Among the key changes:

* Runs on all major modern desktop operating systems: Windows, Linux, and macOS
* Features a redesigned UI inspired by Command and Conquer 3, making it more user-friendly than the original
* Provides fully functional online and LAN multiplayer
* Adds quality-of-life improvements such as (semi-)automatic resource harvesting, the ability to queue multiple unit/building types for production, and to queue up multiple commands for units/buildings
* ... and many more! A full list of changes will be posted later and updated regularly.

(While both Skirmish mode and all single-player campaigns from the original game and Mission Packs are not yet available, our goal is to fully implement them in the future.)


## How can I play OpenE2140?

## Why can't I use the demo version of Earth 2140 to play OpenE2140?

Demo versions of Earth 2140 do not contain all the required game assets, therefore it cannot be used to play OpenE2140. See [How to Play OpenE2140 page]({% link how-to-play.md %}#demo-version) for more information.

## What are game assets or OpenRA?

### Game assets

Game assets are graphics, sounds and/or animations for the user interface, unit, building, and other parts of a game. It can also include videos (like cutscenes) and music.

### OpenRA

OpenRA is an open-source RTS game engine. It also refers to the official games (C&C Red Alert, C&C Tiberian Dawn and Dune 2000; all remakes of classic RTS games), which are based on it and are created by the development team behind the OpenRA. OpenRA is very extensible and since Earth 2140 uses core mechanics of the C&C games, OpenE2140 also uses the engine as its core. This allows speeding up the development and does not require creating everything necessary for an RTS game from scratch.
