# Cookie Policy

This site uses a minimal set of cookies to remember your cookie choices and to control whether analytics are loaded. We care about your privacy: our analytics provider (Umami) is a privacy-focused, cookie-less analytics platform.

## Cookies we use

We use two simple cookies to manage the cookie banner and your consent choice:

| Cookie name | Value | Purpose | Type & Duration |
|-------------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `showCookieBanner` | `true` or `false` | Controls whether the cookie banner (consent prompt) is shown. Set to `false` after you dismiss the banner so it isn't shown repeatedly. | Functional — 365 days |
| `cookiesAccepted` | `true` or `false` | Records whether you accepted cookies. If `true`, the site will load our analytics script (Umami). If `false`, analytics will not be loaded. | Preference — 365 days |

**Note:** The `cookiesAccepted` cookie itself is used only to remember your choice and is not used for tracking.

## About our analytics (Umami)

We use Umami for site analytics. Umami is a privacy-friendly, cookie-less analytics platform that does not store personal data or set tracking cookies by default. Even though Umami is cookie-less, we honor your choice: we only load the Umami script when your `cookiesAccepted` cookie is set to `true`.

## How to change or revoke your consent

You can change or revoke your cookie consent at any time by:
- Clearing the `cookiesAccepted` and `showCookieBanner` cookies in your browser, or
- Using the cookie settings option on the site (if provided), which will update those cookies accordingly.

If you clear or remove the stored preferences, the cookie banner may be shown again so you can reselect your preference.
