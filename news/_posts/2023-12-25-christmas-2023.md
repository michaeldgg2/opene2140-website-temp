Hello everyone!

As the time passes and we're getting closer to the end of the year, we'd like to wish everyone merry Christmas, lots of gifts and happy new year!

<div class="columns is-centered">
    <div class="column is-6">
        {% include image-card.html image='/images/news/2023-12-25-opene2140-xmas-2023.jpg' alt="Merry Christmas!" %}
    </div>
</div>

Make sure to follow OpenE2140's development in 2024: we're slowly advancing forward and the first playable public release is getting closer!
