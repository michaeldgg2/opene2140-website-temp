Hello everyone!

After more than 12 months, we've reached another milestone: Preview 7!

It contains one of the most important features: resource harvesting. Aside from that it also shows building walls using Miners and some other minor improvements.

## First public release

Since the resource harvesting is finally implemented, we can now focus on making the first public release. It requires a bit more time, since there are some minor things that require fixing/polishing. Plus we've fallen behind the development of the OpenRA engine, so we need to upgrade to get latest fixes and improvements. Rest assured, that first release is definitely coming.
