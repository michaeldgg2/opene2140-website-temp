**TL;DR:** If you can't wait to play, head over to [Download page]({% link download.html %}) for links and [How To Play page]({% link how-to-play.md %}) for instructions on how to install and start playing OpenE2140. We do recommend to read the release notes below as they contain useful information.

### Multiplayer early access

While the game is fully playable, it is still an early access release - OpenE2140 is not complete. Despite that most of the gameplay and UI features are implemented. Since the AI isn't available (yet), the main focus of this release is the multiplayer.

We understand that this might be a bit disappointing for some people. Earth 2140 was mainly a singleplayer game after all. However, making AI to work with the specifics of Earth 2140 (mainly base building) is going to take some time. We've focused on adding as much gameplay features as possible before making this public release, because that's what's actually most important: without units and buildings, you can't really play an RTS game like Earth 2140.

We think that you being able to play multiplayer games with other people might actually be interesting, because only the old DOS version of Earth 2140 had multiplayer - and even that was hard to get working (all Windows versions came without multiplayer and they never received it after their release).

We've set up dedicated multiplayer servers, which you can use to play OpenE2140 with other people over the internet. They're all located in Europe. We will add more, if these are not going to be enough:

### Main changes from Earth 2140

The first thing you'll notice when you start OpenE2140 is that the UI is different from the original one. For some people it might take a while to get familiar with it, but people with experience from C&C games (especially the modern ones like the C&C3: Tiberium Wars), will immediately recognize it and get used to it very quickly.

As for the gameplay, expect what you saw in the launch trailer above - unit production queues, unit stances, HCU-M automatic repair, automatic ore transport and more! We'll post a list of changes and improvements soon.

### Missing features and other known issues
As mentioned before, OpenE2140 is not complete. There are many features still yet to be implemented, bugs to fix and UI to polish. However most of these are minor and they don't affect overall feeling of the game.

The biggest missing feature is the AI. While you can start a Skirmish game, there's no AI player to play with. The Skirmish is still useful though: you can try everything out, at your own pace. And then perhaps play online with other people too.

For more information on known issues head over to [Known issues page]({% link known-issues.md %}) to find out what to expect from this release. You don't have to worry though, we intend to finish remaking Earth 2140 in its entirety, so everything from that list will be fixed and/or implemented eventually.

### Versioning
As mentioned OpenE2140 is currently in the multiplayer early access phase. For versioning, we've decided to follow OpenRA's scheme:

**release-yyyyMMdd**, where yyyyMMdd is release date in format year, month, day.

Therefore the current version is `release-202510??`.

### Feedback
This is the first time you get to play OpenE2140 and we'd really appreciate your feedback. We did receive some over the past two years, but it based only on videos and screenshots what we've shown you, without you actually playing the game.
